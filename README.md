# zkSync Era Consensus Layer

This repo implements the consensus algorithm for the era blockchain. We implement all the necessary components for a set of sequencers to reach consensus over blocks (which right now are represented just as binary blobs). In the future, this codebase will also be capable of running full nodes and, after we integrate with the rest of the server, of reaching consensus over real blocks.
