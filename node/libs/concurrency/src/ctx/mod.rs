//! Implementation of the golang Context (https://pkg.go.dev/context).
//! You can think of context as a runtime equivalent of the rust lifetime:
//! As soon as its context is canceled the function should return ASAP,
//! without doing any further blocking calls.
//!
//! It is NOT possible to extend the context provided by the caller, who defines
//! how long it allows the function call to execute.
//!
//! Context is essentially a cancellation token which should be passed
//! down the call stack, so that it can be awaited together with every blocking call:
//! Instead of "awaiting for new data on the channel", you "await for new data on the channel OR
//! for context to get canceled". This way you can implement graceful shutdown
//! in a very uniform way.
