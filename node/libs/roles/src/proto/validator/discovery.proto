// A message broadcasted by a validator

  // Version of the discovery announcement.
  // Newer (higher) version overrides the older version.
  // When a validator gets restarted it broadcasts
  // its discovery message with version = 0. If it learns
  // from the network a newer version of its own discovery message
  // it immediately broadcasts another one to override the received one
  // (it may happen, since it broadcasted its discovery message also during
  // the previous execution).
  //
  // Currently the IP of the validator is static, but this scheme might also
  // be used to provide dynamic IP support (if validator discovers that its
  // own IP has changed - by pinging a trusted STUN server for example - it can
  // broadcast a new discovery message), or (multi)proxy support (a validator
  // may maintain a dynamic set of trusted proxy servers which forward traffic
  // to it - this way validator wouldn't have to have a public IP at all).
  optional uint64 version = 2; // required
  // Time at which this message has been signed.
  // Mostly an informational field:
  // we cannot use it instead of version field,
  // because the walltime clock is not guaranteed to be monotone.
  // We use it as a version "tie breaker" though:
  // we compare (version,timestamp) lexicographically to
  // decide which discovery message is newer.
  // It is useful in the following scenario:
  // 1. validator broadcasts discovery message with (version1,timestamp1)
  // 2. validator gets restarted and forgets what it has broadcasted.
  // 3. validator broadcasts discovery message with (version1,timestamp2)
  // 4. as long as timestamp1 != timestamp2, one of the messages will be considered
  //    newer and eventually all nodes will learn this message. It wouldn't be the
  //    case if both messages had exactly the same version - nodes would keep
  //    the first message that arrived and decline to broadcast the other.
  //
  // Note that although we DO NOT assume timestamps to be monotone,
  // we assume here that it is unlikely for timestamps to collide.
  // To make this reasoning more strict, we should rather use a random "tie breaker"
  // instead (replace timestamp with a random nonce, or use a hash of the entire message).
  optional std.Timestamp timestamp = 3; // required
