//! Gossip network is a sparse graph of connections between nodes (not necessarily validators).
//! It will be used for:
//! * discovery of validators (consensus network will be bootstrapped from data received over
//!   the gossip network).
//! * broadcasting the finalized blocks
//! * P2P block synchronization (for non-validators)
//!
//! Gossip network consists of
//! * static connections (explicitly declared in configs of both ends of the connection).
//! * dynamic connections (additional randomized connections which are established to improve
//!   the throughput of the network).
//! Static connections constitute a rigid "backbone" of the gossip network, which is insensitive to
//! eclipse attack. Dynamic connections are supposed to improve the properties of the gossip
//! network graph (minimize its diameter, increase connectedness).
