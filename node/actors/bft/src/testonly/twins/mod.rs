//! Utilities to implement some of the ideas in the [Twins paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.10617) for testing Byzantine behaviour.
//!
//! The main concepts are:
//! * If we have a committee of n=5f+1 nodes, then up to f nodes can have a _twin_ in the network with the same validator key, but different network keys.
//!   These nodes behave in an honest way in terms of state machine implementation, but because their memory is isolated and they receive different messages,
//!   they can exhibit Byzantine behaviour such as equivocation and amnesia.
//! * In each round (view) we partition the nodes into disjunct groups, and the mock network in the test will only allow communication between nodes in the
//!   same partition in that round. This way the test controls the sub-quorum sizes, e.g. by reshuffling the partitions it can show 2f+1 high votes on the
//!   previous leader's proposal.
//! * The test controls who is the leader in each round; when a validator key is leading, its twin is also leading.
//! * The test generates all possible combinations and permutations, and prune to keep the interesting ones (e.g. make sure there is 4f+1 sized partitions eventually).
//!   In practice we only take a sample because with practical committee sizes there is a combinatorial explosion.
